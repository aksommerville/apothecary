# Thirty Second Apothecary

Dot Vine delivers medicine by riding her broom through the city.

Requires [Egg](https://github.com/aksommerville/egg) to build.

For [HEAVENJAM #1](https://itch.io/jam/heavenjam-1), 2025-01-27 .. 2025-02-03.

## Plan

- Orthgraphic racing, think Micro Machines.
- Pick up from the apothecary, then they tell you where to deliver it.
- Pick up and delivery both give you some boost time, a decreasing amount each time.
- Play until you run out of time.
